# Why is it a bad idea to use recursion method to find the fibonacci of a number?

The problem with using the recursion method to find the fibanacci of a number is that during each recursive call the same value will be calculated again and again for the calculation of a Fibonacci term and this will take more time and more stack space. Also as the number becomes higher it takes longer to process due to the heavy push-pop of the stack memory in each call. 

# Write a function that takes in a Proth Number and uses Proth's theorem to determine if said number is prime? You can write this in any programming language but C/C++/Golang are preferred
